## Hey there! ##

I'm Joel, a web developer pumped about crafting awesome online experiences. I dive deep into frontend tech like jQuery, ReactJs, Redux, and Bootstrap, while also rocking it with backend languages like PHP. Plus, I'm fluent in the frontend trio: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

ðŸ”­ I'm all about making slick user interfaces that pop and backend systems that handle data like a boss.

âš¡ Let's build some killer websites together!
